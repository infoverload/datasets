# Northwind Dataset Example

## How to use

### 1. Clone GitHub repository

Get started by cloning the repo and navigating into this directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:infoverload/datasets.git
cd datasets/datasets/sqlite/northwind
```

### 2. Launch Prisma's development mode to access Prisma Studio

Prisma's development mode provides you with an endpoint for Prisma Studio (note that you need to install the Node.js dependencies first since the `prisma2` CLI is included there):

```
npm install
npm run prisma2 dev
```

You can now open Prisma Studio on: [`http://localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555).

### 3. (Optional) Run demo script

This folder also contains a runnable demo script that you can execute as follows:

```
npm start 
```

Expand below to see what that console output looks like.
