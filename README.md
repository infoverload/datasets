# Datasets for everyone! 

Datasets are collections of data that corresponds to the contents of a single database table and relates to a certain subject.  They can be leveraged to tell stories, help you investigate an issue, or give you deeper understanding into hypotheses.   

A lot of applications and algorithms depend heavily on large samples of data to ensure quality.  Generally speaking, the more complicated the task is, the more data is required. A lot of public datasets are available for you to explore, such as [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets).

At Prisma, we recognize that a lot of open and public datasets are tailored for data science and machine learning purposes and we know that it is valuable to have a smaller batch of interesting and realistic data to work with that is also easy to set up. Our goal is to curate a collection of datasets that contain smaller batches of interesting data that is also easy to set up with popular databases (i.e. MySQL, PostgreSQL).
