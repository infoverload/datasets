# Datasets for everyone! 

Datasets are collections of data that corresponds to the contents of a single database table and relates to a certain subject.  They can be leveraged to tell stories, help you investigate an issue, or give you deeper understanding into hypotheses.   

A lot of applications and algorithms depend heavily on large samples of data to ensure quality.  Generally speaking, the more complicated the task is, the more data is required. A lot of public datasets are available for you to explore, such as [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets).

At Prisma, we recognize that a lot of open and public datasets are tailored for data science and machine learning purposes and we know that it is valuable to have a smaller batch of interesting and realistic data to work with that is also easy to set up. 

Our goal is to curate a collection of datasets that contain smaller batches of interesting data that is also easy to set up with popular databases (i.e. MySQL, PostgreSQL). 

Right now, we organize the collection by database type.
